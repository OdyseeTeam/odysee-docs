# How to sign up

:::info Important

To use AR on Odysee, you'll need to create or sign in to Wander—a cryptocurrency wallet that supports AR. For a quicker setup, you can sign up and create your wallet using a social media account or your email address. Just follow the step-by-step guide below.

:::

### Sign up and create your wallet using Social Media

To sign up and create a wallet, you can use your social media account. Connect using platforms like Google, Facebook, X, or Apple. Signing up takes just one click, and you'll always remain in full control of your funds.

Simply select your preferred social network and authorize Wander Wallet to access your account.

### Sign up and create your wallet using Email

If you prefer to sign up and create a wallet using your email address, simply fill out the form, create a secure password, and wait for the verification code to arrive in your inbox.

### Sign up, create or recover your wallet with another device

You can create or recover your wallet from other devices. Use your mobile device and log in to Odysee with your email and password. Then, go to the wallet page and create or sign up using the different options, email, or social media.

![Wallet](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/4c424239c2f459795c4359e188adbe7e.webp)

If you need to recover your wallet, you can use several options. You can recover it using the seed, importing the keyfile, or scanning the QR code.

Once your wallet is restored, you can synchronize your wallet across multiple devices.

**Wallet recovery requires the username (e.g., email and password/social media login) and the file on new devices, browsers, etc.**

You don't need to password protect it unless your primary login isn't properly protected.

## Full backup

**Private keys:** Make sure you protect them properly and don't store them in the cloud. This can be used to restore your wallet without access to your login.

:::info Important

For backups, you must have backup copies of your seed in different secure locations, such as a password manager, keyfiles, or the QR code.

You can find more information on the [Wander website](https://www.wander.app/help/what-is-a-wander-connect-recovery-file).

### Protect Your Wallet: Back Up your security phrase

Once you've connected and created your wallet with Wander, you'll need to back up your recovery phrase. Below, you can see some of the options available for backup. You can download the recovery file, export the wallet, or generate a QR code.

![AR wallet](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/b5f8f271ca5fd8f434bd3837245cbd75.webp)

Your security phrase (**or seed phrase**) is the master key to your wallet. If you lose access to your device, these 12 or 24 words will be your only way to recover your funds. It's crucial to keep them in a secure, offline location.

:::info Important

Write them down on paper and store them in a secure place, such as a password manager like **Bitwarden**, or use an encrypted storage device. Never share them with anyone or store them in cloud storage.

## Welcome to your wallet

The Wallet Overview page displays your balances and gives you access to key features. From here, you can deposit funds, send payments and view your Arweave account.

![Wallet](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/c2e9fd308ec62e4eb00a56a92ed856a5.webp)

## Your Arweave account

This is your central hub, where you can view your wallet address, send and receive payments to anyone, anywhere and enable monetization features to start earning from your content.

## Allow monetization

Enabling this option lets you receive one-time payments and tips, as well as set up memberships. We highly recommend backing up your wallet and its recovery file, and storing both somewhere safe. In the Wallet, go to Account > Backup to generate a QR code you can scan to sign in on other devices. We never see your wallet or recovery file, so if you lose them we can't restore your account.

## Purchasing AR

To add funds to your wallet, click **Deposit Funds** on the **Wallet Overview** page. You can buy AR using payment methods like Visa, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. Just choose your preferred option and complete the purchase. Your AR tokens will be ready to use on Odysee in minutes.

If a user has enabled monetization under their Arweave account, you can send tips to their channel or content and/or one-time payments with AR.

## How to create a wallet with Wander Extension?

![Wander](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/a556307b756714f7f557b24ed8c84176.webp)

## 1. Setting Up Your Wallet Access Password

The first step in creating your wallet is to set up an access password. This password is required every time you use the wallet in your browser. It adds an essential layer of security, and if forgotten, you can reset it using your seed phrase—a backup we'll cover in the next step.

## 2. Enable permissions

For the best experience, please enable the following permissions. You can always change these later.

## 3. Complete the installation of Wander

Once you've created your wallet, you'll need to take a brief tour of the wallet and configure your wallet's security and backup settings.

## 4. Securing Your Seed Phrase

The seed phrase is the most critical part of setting up your wallet. It consists of 12 randomly generated words that allow you to recover your wallet on any device. Follow these guidelines to protect your seed phrase:

* Write it down on a **secure piece of paper**, or alternatively, consider storing it in a trusted password manager like Bitwarden, which provides an encrypted and secure environment for sensitive information.
* **Never store it unprotected digitally**, not in plain text on your phone, computer, or online services.
* Keep it private, as anyone with access to these words can control your wallet.
* We recommend using a password manager to back up your private key.

The example seed phrase shown in illustrations is for educational purposes only. Never share your real seed phrase with anyone.

We recommend **pinning the Wander extension to your browser** for quick access and a smoother experience.

## FAQ:

1. If prompted for recovery shares on same device, try refreshing. If not, the device may have lost the data, and will require the recovery file, QR code from another device, or full wallet backup.

2. If you get an error about Payment Verification Failed, check your balance and try again.

3. If you need to change the Odysee account a wallet is connected to, please reach out to help@odysee.com. Only 1 Odysee account have been actively linked to a wallet.

4. The most recent and default + active wallet is used for payments, tipping, and memberships. You may have connected other wallets, and you'll be prompted to register new ones or make existing ones default when you change your wallet.

5. Disconnect Wallet will sign you out of Wander too.
