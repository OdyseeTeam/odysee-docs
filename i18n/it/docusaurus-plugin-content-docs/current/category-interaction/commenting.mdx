As well, you can:

- Use stickers by the clicking the smiley icon under the comment box and selecting the *Stickers* tab.
- You can attach a tip to comments by clicking either the LBC symbol or Dollar sign.

## Viewing Past Comments

You can view your entire content history in the settings menu.

# Reposting

Have you seen a video so great that you'd like to share it for others to see? You can do this through *reposting*

Reposting a video will cause it to appear on your Channel's page, under *Content*.

Reposting a video can, depending on the amount staked, increase a video's discoverability on Odysee. For more information on this, check out our section on [Naming](https://help.odysee.tv/category-blockchain/category-staking/naming).
