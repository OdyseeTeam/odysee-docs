# Reposting

Have you seen a video so great that you'd like to share it for others to see? You can do this through *reposting*

Reposting a video will cause it to appear on your Channel's page, under *Content*.

Reposting a video can, depending on the amount staked, increase a video's discoverability on Odysee. For more information on this, check out our section on [Naming](https://help.odysee.tv/category-blockchain/category-staking/naming).
