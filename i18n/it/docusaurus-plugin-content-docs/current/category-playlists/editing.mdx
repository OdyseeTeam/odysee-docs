# Editing Playlists

To edit a playlist, first navigate to the playlists menu by clicking the **Playlists** button on the sidebar.

Hover over the playlist you'd like to publish, click the three dot menu on the right, and select **Edit**.

From here, you can edit the Title, Thumbnail, and Description under **General**.

Under **Items**, you can edit the videos within the playlist.

- Remove videos by clicking the trash can icon.
- Move a video up or down by clicking the arrows directly next to the trash can icon.
- Send videos to the top or bottom by clicking the arrows with lines next to them.
- The button at the very left allows you to drag videos in the playlist. Click and hold, and move the video where you'd like.

After making edits, click the **Submit** button at the bottom of the General tab.

**Note: You'll need to publish your playlist for these changes to be made public.**
