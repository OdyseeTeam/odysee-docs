# How to sign up

:::info Important

To use AR on Odysee, you'll need to create or sign in to Wander - a cryptocurrency wallet that supports AR. For a quicker setup, you can sign up and create your wallet using a social media account or your email address. Just follow the step-by-step guide below.

### Sign up and create your wallet using Social Media

To sign up and create a wallet, you can use your social media account. Connect using platforms like Google, Facebook, X, or Apple. Signing up takes just a few clicks, and you'll always remain in full control of your funds. After you login, you'll be prompted to connect your wallet to Odysee, and to back it up. **We strongly recommend backing up both the recovery file, and full backup (key file / seed phrase)**. [Learn more about backups](https://help.odysee.tv/category-monetization/wander).

Simply select your preferred social network and authorize Wander Wallet to access your account.

### Sign up and create your wallet using Email

If you prefer to sign up and create a wallet using your email address, simply fill out the form, create a secure password, and wait for the verification code to arrive in your inbox.

### Sign into your wallet with another device

You can sign into your wallet from other devices such as other browsers or mobile, you would log in to Odysee with your email and password if not already signed in. Then go to the wallet page to sign into your Wallet using the same login as your original Wander account. You'll then be prompted for a recovery file or QR code option. QR would be the easiest - you would access the original device, go to Arweave Account > Open Wallet, and click Account > Backup > QR Code and finally scan it using the new device.

If you need to recover your wallet, you can use several options. You can recover it using the seed, importing the keyfile, or scanning the QR code similar to the sign in with new device scenario.

**Wallet sign in requires the username (e.g., email and password/social media login) and the Wallet recovery file on new devices, browsers, etc.**

## Welcome to your wallet

The Wallet Overview page displays your balances and gives you access to key features. From here, you can deposit funds, send payments and view your Arweave account.

## Your Arweave account

This is your central hub, where you can view your wallet address, send and receive payments to anyone, anywhere and enable monetization features to start earning from your content.

## Allow monetization

Enabling this option lets you receive one-time payments and tips, as well as set up memberships. We highly recommend backing up your wallet and its recovery file, and storing both somewhere safe. In the Wallet, go to Account > Backup to generate a QR code you can scan to sign in on other devices. We never see your wallet or recovery file, so if you lose them we can't restore your account.

## Send payments

If a user has enabled monetization under their Arweave account, you can send tips to their channel or content and/or one-time payments with AR.

## Purchasing AR

To add funds to your wallet, click **Deposit Funds** on the **Wallet Overview** page. You can buy AR using payment methods like Visa, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. Just choose your preferred option and complete the purchase. Your AR tokens will be ready to use on Odysee in minutes.

## FAQ:

1. If prompted for recovery shares on same device, try refreshing first. If not, the device may have lost the data, and will require the recovery file, QR code from another device, or full wallet backup.

2. If you get an error about Payment Verification Failed, check your balance and try again.

3. If you need to change the Odysee account a wallet is connected to, please reach out to help@odysee.com. Only 1 Odysee account have been actively linked to a wallet.

4. The most recent (default) and active wallet is used for receiving payments, tipping, and memberships fees. You may have connected other wallets, and you'll be prompted to register new ones or make existing ones default when you change your wallet.

5. Disconnect Wallet will sign you out of your Wander wallet also.
