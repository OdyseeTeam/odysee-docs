# Overview

From the donor portal screen, you can view each of the channel memberships you've joined.

This shows the name of the channel you've joined, the tier name, how long you've been a supporter, the amount per month you've joined for, and whether the membership is still active.

The pink button with the rocketship icon will take you to that channel's membership page.
