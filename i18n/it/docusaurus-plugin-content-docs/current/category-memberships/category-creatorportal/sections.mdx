# Creator Portal Sections

*If you haven't connected your bank account, you won't be able to set up tiers. To do this, you can view our guide [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category-basics/bankaccount).*

After entering the Creator Portal, you'll notice three different tabs. These tabs are:

**Overview**

The Overview tab shows the total number of supporters, estimated monthly income, and total amount received to date from all of your channels.

Under *Page* you'll see a button with a rocketship icon. This takes you to the membership page on your channel. The *URL* button allows you to copy the URL of your channel's membership page.

**My Supporters**

The My Supporters tab shows your supporters on each of your channels. You can switch between your channels using the dropdown box at the top of the menu.

On each supporter's row, you'll see their:

- Channel name
- Donation tier
- Donation amount per month
- Join date
- Months supporting summary

**My Tiers**

On the My Tiers tab you'll be able to create, edit, and view your own tiers on each channel.

You can switch between your channels using the dropdown box at the top of the menu.
