# Transaction Types & History

From the wallet page, you can switch to the **Transactions** tab. This will show your transaction history. You can visit your Odysee account transaction page [here.](https://odysee.com/$/wallet?tab=fiat-payment-history&currency=credits)

From here, you can filter between Credits and Cash transactions, and between various Credits transaction types. These are:

| Type        | Details |
------------- | ---------------
| **Sent** | Credits is sent to a wallet address - sent Credits, outgoing tips, or content purchases.
| **Receive** | Credits received at a wallet address - received Credits, incoming tips, or content purchases. ***Active** = currently supporting your content. **Historical** = claimed into your balance.*
| **Uploads** | Credits claim associated with content publication. Claims can be revoked via trash icon<sup>1</sup>. Historical records are previous updates.
| **Channel** | Credits claim associated with Channel creation. Channel claims can be revoked via trash button. Historical records are previous updates.
| **Repost** | Link to another Credit claim. Reposts can be revoked via trash icon.
| **Support** | Credits used to support your own or other content. Support claims can be revoked via trash icon. ***Active** = currently locked. **Historical** = revoked.*

Under Currency transactions (meaning USD or Euros), the only filters are between *Incoming* and *Outgoing*.
