# Integrated Wander Wallet

The easiest way to use the Odysee payments system is to [sign up for an account](https://help.odysee.tv/category-monetization/setup) directly with Wander that's integrated into Odysee. This will create aa wallet that's tied to your login method, and personalized recovery share that's also required to be used on other browsers, devices, mobile, etc. You'll also want to have a full backup of the wallet in case you lose access to your login, or your device (recovery) share. 

## Recovery file

The recovery file is used in combination with your Wander login to help restore your wallet on devices in case local data loss, or other devices you use with the same wallet. This file alone cannot be used to access your wallet, so you can safely store it on Cloud storage for easy access. You will however require the Wander account access to use alongside this recovery file. 

You can find more information on the [Wander website](https://www.wander.app/help/what-is-a-wander-connect-recovery-file).

## Backup Your Wallet: Key file or seed phrase

**Private keys:** Make sure you protect them properly and don't store them in the cloud. This can be used to restore your wallet without access to your login. 

Once you've connected and created your wallet with Wander, you'll need to back up your recovery phrase. Below, you can see some of the options available for backup. You can download the recovery file, export the wallet, or generate a QR code.

Your security phrase (**or seed phrase**) is the master key to your wallet. If you lose access to your device, these 12 or 24 words will be your only way to recover your funds. It's crucial to keep them in a secure, offline location.

If you are storing the Keyfile, make sure to password protect it in case someone gains unauthorized access. 

:::info Important

Write them down on paper and store them in a secure place, such as a password manager like **Bitwarden**, or use an encrypted storage device. Never share them with anyone or store them in cloud storage.

## Wander Wallet Extension and Wander App
Another option for an Arweave wallet, outside of the Odysee integrated version, is the Wander Extension and Mobile app. Available on iOS, Android, and as a browser extension, Wander Wallet makes it more secure to manage your AR token directly in Odysee. [Download Wander to get started](https://www.wander.app/). We'd recommend this option if you are more familar with Crypto wallets or are a native crypto user.

## How to create a wallet with Wander?

![Wander](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/a556307b756714f7f557b24ed8c84176.webp)

## 1. Setting Up Your Wallet Access Password

The first step in creating your wallet is to set up an access password. This password is required every time you use the wallet in your browser. It adds an essential layer of security, and if forgotten, you can reset it using your seed phraseâ€”a backup we'll cover in the next step.

## 4. Securing Your Seed Phrase

The seed phrase is the most critical part of setting up your wallet. It consists of 12 randomly generated words that allow you to recover your wallet on any device. Follow these guidelines to protect your seed phrase:

* Write it down on a **secure piece of paper**, or alternatively, consider storing it in a trusted password manager like Bitwarden, which provides an encrypted and secure environment for sensitive information.
* **Never store it unprotected digitally**, not in plain text on your phone, computer, or online cloud services like iCloud, Google Drive etc.
* Keep these words secure. Anyone who obtains them can take full control of your wallet.
* We recommend using a password manager to back up your private key.

The example seed phrase shown in the image below is for educational purposes only. Never share your real seed phrase with anyone.
