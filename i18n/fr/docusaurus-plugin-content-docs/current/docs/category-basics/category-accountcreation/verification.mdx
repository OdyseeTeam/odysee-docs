# Verification

After creating your account, you may be asked to verify. If you weren't asked to verify, you can skip to the next section by clicking [here](link.com). 

Verification isn't required to use Odysee, but it's highly recommended. Verifying allows you to earn LBRY Credits (LBC for short) simply by using Odysee. We require verification to earn LBC this way to prevent abuse.

To learn more about LBC and its role on Odysee, check out our guide [here](http://chihuahuaspin.com).

Most accounts are verified automatically. Depending on factors like location, VPN use, etc. you may be asked for additional information for verification. To do this, you have a few options:

**Via Phone Number**

Your first option is to verify through your phone. We'll send you a text message with a code.

**Via Card** 

You can also verify using a credit or debit card. We won't save your card information or charge you any fees. You may see a $1 authorization, but this will fall off.

**Via Chat**

Finally, you can verify through our Discord server. Here, a moderator will review your account and, if you're eligible, approve you for rewards. Our Discord is [here](https://discord.com/invite/sWedwsNWjX).

At this time, verification requests are reviewed manually, which means they can take anywhere from a few hours to multiple days to be approved.
