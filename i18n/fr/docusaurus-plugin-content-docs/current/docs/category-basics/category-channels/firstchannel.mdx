# Creating Your First Channel

In order to do things such as like, dislike, comment, and create playlists, you'll need to create a channel.

Click the person icon at the top right corner (if you already have a channel, this icon will be your channel's profile picture), and click on **Channels**.

If you were trying to sync your YouTube channel, you can also click the **Sync YouTube Channel** option without having to create a new account.
