# Deleting Channels

To delete a channel, you have a few options.

You can delete them on the **Channels** page, using the three button menu.

You can also delete a channel using the three button menu on the channel itself.

Or, if you decide to delete a channel while in the middle of editing, there's a delete option in the edit menu as well.
