# Introduction

Most media platforms handle moderation in one of two ways: either the video platform itself has very strict rules for what can and can't be said in comment sections, or there are absolutely no rules whatsoever and commenters can say whatever they want wherever they want. 

Odysee has a different approach. We strongly believe in allowing creators to decide what is or is not tolerable in their own spaces. This means Odysee as a platform staying out of the way, while also giving creators tools for dealing with bad actors as they see fit.

This section will cover the various moderation tools Odysee creators have to manage their own comment sections.
