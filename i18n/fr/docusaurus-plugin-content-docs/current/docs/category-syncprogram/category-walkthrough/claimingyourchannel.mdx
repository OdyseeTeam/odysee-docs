# Claiming Your Channel

Next, whether the sync is to a new or existing account, you'll be taken to this screen. Here, you'll choose a channel name, language, and confirm your desire to sync.

**Your channel name cannot be changed in the future, so choose wisely.**

If everything looks right, you'll select **Claim Now**.

Next, you'll be asked to sign into your Google account. This is to make sure you really own the channel you're attempting to sync.

After confirming your google account, your channel will begin syncing and you'll be taken to this screen.

Syncing can take several hours, but you don't have to leave this screen open while waiting. You can explore the rest of Odysee, or close out of Odysee entirely.

You can monitor the sync progress on the **Channels** Page.

Click the person icon at the top right corner (if you already have a channel, this icon will be your channel's profile picture), and click on **Channels**.

Once your channel is finished syncing, you'll be able to claim it on the **Channels** screen. Claiming your channel allows you to start using it and receiving rewards.
