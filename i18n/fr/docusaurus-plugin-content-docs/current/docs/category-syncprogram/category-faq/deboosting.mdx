# Will Syncing Deboost My Channel?

No. Odysee has tens of thousands of synced YouTube channels, and we have never heard of anyone being banned, shadowbanned, or otherwise punished for syncing. In fact, we've seen several cases of channels skyrocketing in popularity *after* syncing to Odysee, which wouldn't be possible had syncing deboosted them.
