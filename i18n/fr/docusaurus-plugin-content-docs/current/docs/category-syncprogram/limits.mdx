# Requirements & Limits

If it was up to us, we'd be syncing every channel that asked with no restrictions. Unfortunately, our YouTube sync resources are limited (especially as Odysee continues to grow) and we have to allocate them as best we can.

## Requirements:

- Your subscription count must be public on YouTube.
- Videos bigger than 2GB will be synced at lower quality (720p, 480p, ...)
- Private or unlisted videos will not be published. Copyrighted and age restricted videos may also be skipped.
- You must have at least 100 YouTube subscribers.

## Limits:

**Note: your channel limits are based on your subscriber count at the time of syncing. If your channel had 200 subscribers when enrolling but is now at 2000 subscribers, your channel would still have the 200 subscriber limits. To request a raise on these limits, email hello@odysee.com.**

For the number of videos we'll sync:

 - If you have fewer than 300 subscribers, only your newest 20 videos will sync.
 - If you have 300-599 subscribers, only your newest 80 videos will sync.
 - If you have 600-799 subscribers, only your newest 200 videos will sync.
 - If you have 800-999 subscribers, only your newest 250 videos will sync.
 - If you have 1000-4999 subscribers, only your newest 400 videos will sync.
 - If you have 5000-9999 subscribers, only your newest 500 videos will sync.
 - For all higher subscriber counts, we will only sync your newest 1000 videos.

For the length of videos we'll sync:

- If you have fewer than 500 subscribers, we will only sync videos under 30 minutes long.
- If you have 500-999 subscribers, we will only sync videos under 1 hour long.
- For all channels over 1000 subscribers, we will only sync videos under 2 hours long.
