# Sending and Receiving LBC

## Sending

To send LBC from the wallet, click the **Send** button from the wallet screen.

From here, you can enter in a direct address. If you have a LBC wallet outside of Odysee, this is where you'd paste it.

Alternatively, you can use the Search tab to find creators within Odysee to send LBC to.

## Receiving

To receive LBC, you'll click the **Receive** button from the wallet screen.

From here, you'll be given your wallet address. If someone sends LBC to this address, it will appear in your wallet on Odysee.
