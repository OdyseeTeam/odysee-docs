# Naming

While viewing a channel or a piece of content, you may have noticed a colon followed by a number or letter at the end of the URL.

This isn't just for show or a stylistic decision. This indicates that particular channel or content's *Claim ID*, which is simply a register of its metadata on LBRY.

Naming on Odysee is like an auction. For example, say there are two uploads with the same URL: "cat."

One URL shows: "odysee.com/cat:7b", and the other shows "odysee.com/cat:a"

If you were to click on the link, "odysee.com/cat," which one of these two videos, that both have the URL "cat," would the link direct to?

The answer is whichever video has the higher LBC stake. Let's say "cat:7b" has the higher LBC stake. To find this video, you could search "odysee.com/cat:7b", or you could simply search "odysee.com/cat" because it has the highest stake.

To find the video with the lower stake, you would have to search the full URL, "odysee.com/cat:a".

The highest staked content will also be reflected on search results within Odysee itself.

If you do a search for "cat" on Odysee, the file with the highest LBC stake for that result will appear at the top of the results.

If the top claim was outbid by a higher stake, the URL wouldn't change immediately. For every month a name is controlled, 1 day is added to the waiting period, for a maximum of 7 days (after 7 months).
