# Creating Playlists

To create a new playlist, first click the **Playlists** button on the sidebar.

From this menu, you'll click **Create Playlist**. Simply give it a name and click the checkmark, and it'll be created.

Until published, created playlists will not be visible for anyone except you.

## Adding Content

To add a video to a playlist, you have a few options.

When not viewing a video, click the three dot menu, select **Add to Playlist**, and select the playlist you'd like to add the video to.

When viewing a video, click **Save** button under the video and select the playlist you'd like to add the video to.
