# Adding a Payment Method

By adding a credit or debit card, you'll be able to tip creators in cash, pre-order videos, and more.

To add a card, you'll first need to open your wallet. Your wallet is towards the top right of the screen, on the menu bar.

On the Payment Methods screen, you'll simply enter your full name, card number, its expiration date, and its 3 digit CVC code.
