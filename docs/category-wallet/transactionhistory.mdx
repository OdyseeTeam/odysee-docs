From here, you can filter between LBC and Cash transactions, and between various LBC transaction types. These are:

------------- | ---------------
| **Sent** | LBC is sent to a wallet address - sent LBC, outgoing tips, or content purchases.
| **Receive** | LBC received at a wallet address - received LBC, incoming tips, or content purchases. ***Active** = currently supporting your content. **Historical** = claimed into your balance.*  
| **Uploads** | LBC claim associated with content publication.Claims can be revoked via trash icon<sup>1</sup>. Historical records are previous updates.
| **Channel** | LBC claim associated with Channel creation. Channel claims can be revoked via trash button. Historical records are previous updates.
| **Repost** | Link to another LBRY claim. Reposts can be revoked via trash icon.
| **Support** | LBC used to support your own or other content. Support claims can be revoked via trash icon. ***Active** = currently locked. **Historical** = revoked.*  

Under Currency transactions (meaning USD or Euros), the only filters are between *Incoming* and *Outgoing*.
