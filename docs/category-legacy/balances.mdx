When viewing your wallet, you'll notice a few different balances. Take a look at all the details.

On the right, you'll see an AR (arweave) balance if you've received tips or memberships. You can learn more about connecting your wallet here.

On the left, your total Credits balance is all of the Credits in your possession. Your immediately spendable balance is exactly that, your Credits that can be spent immediately.

## Credits Boosting Content

Next is your balance that's boosting content. This includes refundable boosts sent to other users, and deposits supporting your own content. You can see the breakdown of this by selecting **View more**.
