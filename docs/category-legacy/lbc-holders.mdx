# What can you do if you still have LBC?

If you still happen to have LBC (LBRY Credits) in your Odysee wallet, don’t worry; there may still be time left for you to transfer them to the centralized exchange **MEXC** and trade them for USDT.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

:::danger

**Please Note:**
This guide works for all countries where MEXC provides its services, except: the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. You can see the complete updated list of restricted or prohibited regions/countries [here](https://www.mexc.com/learn/article/list-of-supported-and-restricted-countries-on-mexc/1).

:::

## Step 1: Create or log in to your MEXC account

Go to the [MEXC website](https://www.mexc.com/) and log in or create a new account.

Once you're logged in, click **"Deposit"** in the upper-right corner of the screen, then choose **"On-Chain Deposit."**

## Step 2: Select LBC as the deposit token

In the next screen, click the **"Select Crypto"** search bar, type **LBC**, and select the correct token from the list.

The network will automatically be set to **LBC**, as it's the only one available for this token. Your deposit address will be shown both as text and as a QR code.

Click **"Copy"** to copy the address. Take note of the warning: transactions on the LBC network typically take **around 4 hours** to complete.

## Step 3: Send LBC from your Odysee wallet

Now go to your Odysee wallet and click **"Send"** in the LBC section.

On the next screen, enter the amount of LBC you want to send under **"Amount"** and paste the MEXC deposit address you copied earlier into the **"Recipient address"** field. Then click **"Send."**

## Step 4: Monitor your deposit on MEXC

Back on MEXC, you can track your deposit status by clicking **"Wallets"** near the top-right corner, then selecting **"Funding History."**

Once the LBC network processes the transaction (which usually takes about 4 hours), the status will change to **"Deposit successful."**

## Step 5: Convert LBC to USDT

To trade your LBC for USDT (currently the only available trading pair), go to the top menu and click **"Spot,"** then click **"Spot"** again in the dropdown.

By default, you’ll see the MX/USDT trading pair. To switch to LBC/USDT, go to the **top left above the chart**, click the arrow next to the current pair name, and type **LBC** into the search bar. Select **LBC/USDT** from the search results.

Once on the LBC/USDT page, go to the third panel on the right-hand side, click **"Sell,"** and choose **"Market"** to sell at the best available market price.

In the **"Amount"** field, enter the number of LBC tokens you want to sell. Then click **"Sell LBC."** In the example below, we're selling 4,435 LBC out of 8,871 total.

**Important:**
The minimum amount of LBC you can sell on MEXC must be equivalent to **1 USDT**.

After clicking **"Sell LBC,"** MEXC will process your order and display the confirmation message: **"Ordered successfully"** at the top of the screen.

## Step 6: Check your USDT balance

To see how much USDT you received, go back to **"Wallets"** in the top-right corner and click **"Spot."**

On the **Spot Wallet** page, scroll down to the **Assets List** section to view your updated USDT balance.
In the example below, we now have **4.98 USDT**.
