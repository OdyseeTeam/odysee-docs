# Sending and Receiving Credits

## Sending

To send Credits from the wallet, click the **Send** button from the wallet screen.

From here, you can enter in a direct address. If you have a Credits wallet outside of Odysee, this is where you'd paste it.

Alternatively, you can use the Search tab to find creators within Odysee to send Credits to.

## Receiving

To receive Credits, you'll click the **Receive** button from the wallet screen.

From here, you'll be given your wallet address. If someone sends Credits to this address, it will appear in your wallet on Odysee.
