# Categories

On the sidebar and the homepage, there are several content categories.

On the homepage, the Trending content in each category will appear.

When clicked into a category, you can sort by New, Trending, and Top.

**New** shows content in the order it was uploaded across all creators within that category.

**Trending** shows the content that has had the greatest increase in tips and supports over the last few hours and days within that category.

**Top** shows the content published within the selected period that has received the largest total amount of tips and supports within that category.
