# DMCA Content

Uploading copyrighted content without fair use is against Odysee's [Community Guidelines](https://help.odysee.tv/communityguidelines). So, how exactly does Odysee handle DMCA requests?

If you have a video, audio, image, or other piece of content channel, it is essential that you know how to address DMCA notices to maintain the integrity of your channel. Here's how you can navigate DMCA notices and manage content claims:

## What is a DMCA request or takedown notice?

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States Copyright Law written to protect digital content against illegal use. When an owner finds their content used on the Internet without their permission, they can file a DMCA request with the website, app, or Internet Service Provider illegally hosting their content, asking for it to be removed.

## Someone uploaded my content to Odysee without permission. How do I report it?

Reporting infringing/illegal content on Odysee is easy. Navigate to the content you wish to report. In the 3 button menu, click "Report."

From here, you'll click "Infringes my rights" and then "Copyright issue."

## Receiving a DMCA Notice

* **Initial Steps:** Upon receiving a DMCA notice, your content might be removed, or you might be notified of a claim against your video. Check your email or your channel's notifications for details.
* **Review the Claim:** Ensure the claim is legitimate. Sometimes, claims might be filed in error.

## Can I dispute a DMCA complaint?

Yes, you may. We can't give you legal advice, so check with your local attorney or legal group about how to do this. There are also good resources online to learn about DMCA counter-notices. The EFF has published an [excellent guide](https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/guide-to-youtube-removals?_ga=2.164141691.539423696.1634061780-1382771933.1616852399) about how to deal with legal issues facing online content creators. If you have done the research or feel the content was blocked mistakenly, please reach out to us.
