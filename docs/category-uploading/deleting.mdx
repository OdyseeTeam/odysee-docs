# Deleting Uploads

To delete an upload completely, click the trash can icon below it. You can also go to the [Uploads page](https://odysee.com/$/uploads) and delete an upload by clicking the 3 dot dropdown menu and then clicking the trash can icon.

As well, you can click delete on the three-dot menu without clicking into the upload. This will remove the content.
