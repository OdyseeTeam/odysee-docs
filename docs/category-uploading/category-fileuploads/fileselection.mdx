From the upload screen, you'll first be asked to select a file. Odysee is best known as a video platform, but you're also able to upload images, audio files, PDFs, CAD files, and just about anything else.

:::note Note:

For videos, you'll need to upload MP4s in H264/AAC format. For the best viewer experience, we recommend bitrates under 8 Mbps.

Odysee uploads are restricted to 16 GB.
