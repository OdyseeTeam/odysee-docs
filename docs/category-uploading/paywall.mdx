Got a high-quality documentary, film, etc. that you'd like to set for rent/purchase? You can do this through Odysee.

You'll first want to make sure you have a bank account linked to Odysee. If you don't, check out our guide [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category-basics/bankaccount).

When uploading a video to the posting form, scroll down to the **Price** section.

![Price](https://thumbs.odycdn.com/581a9486917bc6ddc30a47f2d110b864.webp)

You can set the purchase price, rental price and rental period using the form.

:::info NOTE:
Purchasing does not allow the user to download the video. It only allows unlimited access to the video through Odysee itself.
:::

Finish uploading, and your video will be locked behind the purchase or rental price:
