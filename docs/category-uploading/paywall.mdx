# Paywall Content

Got a high-quality documentary, film, etc. that you'd like to set for rent/purchase? You can do this through Odysee.

You'll first want to make sure you have a bank account linked to Odysee. If you don't, check out our guide [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category-basics/bankaccount).

When uploading a video, scroll down to the **Tags** section.

You'll be able to set the purchase price, rental price, and rental time using tags.

To set a purchase price, enter **purchase:[price]**. For example, if you'd like to set the purchase price to $9.99, you'd enter **purchase:9.99**.

Hit enter, and you'll see the purchase tag under **Selected Tags**.

:::info NOTE:
Purchasing does not allow the user to download the video. It only allows unlimited access to the video through Odysee itself.
:::

To enter the rental price and time to rent, you'll use the Rental tag. The rental tag is **rental:[price]:[time in seconds]**. For example, if you'd like to set the rental price to $4.99 and the rental time to 24 hours, you'd enter **rental:4.99:86400**.

Hit enter, and you'll see the rental tag under **Selected Tags**.

Finish uploading, and your video will be locked behind the purchase or rental price:
