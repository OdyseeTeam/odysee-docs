Please note: With the transation of Odysee to the new payments system, there are three things to keep in mind:

:::

1. Once you [sign up for a wallet](https://help.odysee.tv/category-monetization/setup), you will have 1 week to make a payment for any existing memberships.
2. Due to the nature of the wallet and decentralized system. you willneed to make recurring monthly payments to keep your membership active. You can do this up to 2 weeks out of your renewal date, no earlier. 
3. You now have the ability to setup lower $ membership tiers, with a minimum of $0.10. You can even update this for existing tiers with members - their next payment will be the updated one. You cannot however set the price higher.
