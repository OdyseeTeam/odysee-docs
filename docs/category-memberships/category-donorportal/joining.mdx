# Joining a Membership

:::info

If you haven't added a payment method, you won't be able to join a membership. To do this, you can view our guide [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category-basics/paymentmethod).

:::

To join a channel's membership tiers, you can either select the orange join button at the top of their channel page, or choose a tier from the Memberships tab.

Selecting the orange join button will bring you to this pop-up, where you can select the specific tier you'd like to join.

Once you've selected your tier, you'll see this pop-up that will show the tier you're joining, it's description, benefits, and your monthly donation amount.
