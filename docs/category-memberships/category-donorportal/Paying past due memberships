Paying a past due membership

If your card was not charged for the membership due to a problem with the banking systems such as a lack of funds availability at the time of charging, then one way to pay the fee and get in good standing is, after mistakingly cancelling in an attempt to re-sign-up to get the charge to go through, the only way available to pay seems to be to navigate to the content of the channel that you want to access, click on a restricted video, and it will give you an option to become a member, which will finally send you to the join and payment dialog which will allow attempting a real time payment that then restores access to the content you wanted.

Someone can try this if they have not tried cancelling membership first, and see what happens.
