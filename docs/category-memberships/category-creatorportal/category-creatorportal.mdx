Please note: With the transation of Odysee to the new payments system, there are two things to keep in mind:

:::

1. Once you [sign up for a wallet](https://help.odysee.tv/category-monetization/setup), your subscribers will have 1 week to make a payment for their membership. If you want us to extend this, please reach out to hello@odysee.com.
2. Due to the nature of the wallet and decentralized system. subscribers will need to make recurring monthly payments to keep their membership active.
