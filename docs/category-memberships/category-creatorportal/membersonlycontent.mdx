# Members-Only Content

If you have members only content or members-only livestreams selected as perk, you'll need to designate which pieces of content are members-only.

## Members-only Uploads

When uploading a video or other file that's meant to be members-only, you'll simply check the Restricted Content box while uploading and select the tiers you'd like it to be available for.

*Note: If you don't have members-only content selected as a perk on any of your tiers, this option will not appear on the upload screen.*

## Members-only Livestreams

When creating a livestream that's meant to be members-only, you'll simply check the Restricted Content box while creating the livestream and select the tiers you'd like it to be available for.

## Members-only Chat/Comments

You can enable members-only chat and comments from the Creator Settings menu.

The Creator Settings menu can be accessed by clicking the profile picture icon in the top right corner and selecting **Settings** in the drop-down menu.

From this screen, the very first two options will be to enable members-only comments and members-only livestream chat.
