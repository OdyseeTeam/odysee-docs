# Moderation Tools

Most media platforms handle moderation in one of two ways: either the video platform itself has very strict rules for what can and can't be said in comment sections, or there are absolutely no rules whatsoever and commenters can say whatever they want wherever they want. 

Odysee has a different approach. We strongly believe in allowing creators to have more control over their moderation decisions in their space, as long it's still stays within the [community guidelines](https://help.odysee.tv/communityguidelines/).

This section will cover the various moderation tools Odysee creators have to manage their own comment sections.
