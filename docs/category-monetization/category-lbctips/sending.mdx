# Sending LBC Tips

To send a tip, you'll click the **Support** button under an upload.

This option is also available on channels.

From this menu, you'll select the **Tip** button with the LBC icon, select an amount, and click **Send Tip**.

This LBC tip will boost the content/channel being tipped, until the creator chooses to unlock it for use elsewhere on Odysee.
