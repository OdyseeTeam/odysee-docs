## How to create a wallet with Wander?

## 1. Setting Up Your Wallet Access Password

The first step in creating your wallet is to set up an access password. This password is required every time you use the wallet in your browser. It adds an essential layer of security, and if forgotten, you can reset it using your seed phraseâ€”a backup we'll cover in the next step.

## 2. Enable permissions

For the best experience, please enable the following permissions. You can always change these later.

## 3. Complete the installation of Wander

Once you've created your wallet, you'll need to take a brief tour of the wallet and configure your wallet's security and backup settings.

## 4. Securing Your Seed Phrase

The seed phrase is the most critical part of setting up your wallet. It consists of 12 randomly generated words that allow you to recover your wallet on any device. Follow these guidelines to protect your seed phrase:

* Write it down on a **secure piece of paper**, or alternatively, consider storing it in a trusted password manager like Bitwarden, which provides an encrypted and secure environment for sensitive information.
* **Never store it unprotected digitally**, not in plain text on your phone, computer, or online cloud services like iCloud, Google Drive etc.
* Keep these words secure. Anyone who obtains them can take full control of your wallet.
* We recommend using a password manager to back up your private key.

We recommend **pinning the Wander extension to your browser** for quick access and a smoother experience.

2. **Send and receive payments:** Use your recently added funds in your wallet to support creators, receive tips, and send payments to anyone, anywhere.
3. **Manage memberships:** Pay for memberships on a flexible schedule by preloading your wallet with funds.
4. **Withdraw your earnings:** Convert your earnings into cash or other cryptocurrencies via external platforms like Kraken or Binance.
