# Verification

Verifying allows you to earn LBRY Credits (LBC for short) simply by using Odysee. This is our rewards program. We require verification to earn rewards to prevent abuse.

Most accounts are verified automatically. Depending on factors like location, VPN use, etc. you may be asked for additional information for verification. To do this, you have a few options:

**Via Phone Number**

Your first option is to verify through your phone. We'll send you a text message with a code.

**Via Card**

You can also verify using a credit or debit card. We won't save your card information or charge you any fees. You may see a $1 authorization, but this will fall off.

**Via Chat**

Finally, you can verify through our Discord server. Here, a moderator will review your account and, if you're eligible, approve you for rewards. Our Discord is here.

At this time, verification requests are reviewed manually, which means they can take anywhere from a few hours to multiple days to be approved.
