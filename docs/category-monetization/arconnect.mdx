## 1. Setting Up Your Wallet Access Password

The first step in creating your wallet is to set up an access password. This password is required every time you use the wallet in your browser. It adds an essential layer of security, and if forgotten, you can reset it using your seed phrase—a backup we'll cover in the next step.

## 2. Securing Your Seed Phrase

The seed phrase is the most critical part of setting up your wallet. It consists of 12 randomly generated words that allow you to recover your wallet on any device. Follow these guidelines to protect your seed phrase:

* Write it down on a **secure piece of paper**, or alternatively, consider storing it in a trusted password manager like Bitwarden, which provides an encrypted and secure environment for sensitive information.
* **Never store it unprotected digitally**, not in plain text on your phone, computer, or online services.
* Keep it private, as anyone with access to these words can control your wallet.
* We recommend using a password manager to back up your private key.

The example seed phrase shown in illustrations is for educational purposes only. Never share your real seed phrase with anyone.

## 3. Verifying Your Seed Phrase

After recording your seed phrase, ArConnect will ask you to complete a quick verification. You'll need to fill in missing words from the sequence to confirm you've saved them correctly. This step ensures you understand the importance of the seed phrase for accessing your wallet.

## 4. Finalizing the Setup

Once you complete the verification, your wallet will be ready to use.
