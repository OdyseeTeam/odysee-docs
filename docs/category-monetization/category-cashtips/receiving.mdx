# Receiving Cash Tips

## Connecting Your Bank Account

To receive a cash tip, you'll need to have a bank account added.

To add a bank account, you'll first need to open <OdyseeButton url="https://odysee.com/$/wallet"><OdyseeIcon type="credits" />  Your Wallet</OdyseeButton>. Your wallet is towards the top right of the screen, on the menu bar.

From here, you'll simply enter the information requested.

## Receiving Cash Tips

After your bank account is added and you're receiving tips, you'll be able to track the amount you've received on your wallet.

Every 2-3 business days, the tips sent to your Odysee wallet will automatically cash out and be sent to your bank account.
