# Receiving Cash Tips

## Connecting Your Bank Account

To receive a cash tip, you'll need to have a bank account added.

To add a bank account, you'll first need to open <OdyseeButton url="https://odysee.com/$/wallet"><OdyseeIcon type="credits" />  Your Wallet</OdyseeButton>. Your wallet is towards the top right of the screen, on the menu bar.

On the mobile version, you'll find it towards the bottom of the sidebar menu.

This takes you outside of Odysee to Stripe.

From here, you'll simply enter the information requested.

## Receiving Cash Tips

After your bank account is added and you're receiving tips, you'll be able to track the amount you've received on your wallet.

Every 2-3 business days, the tips sent to your Odysee wallet will automatically cash out and be sent to your bank account.
