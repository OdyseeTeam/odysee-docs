Arweave is a decentralized storage protocol that allows data to be permanently stored on the blockchain. Odysee uses Arweave's native **AR** token to enable sending payments, tips, or establishing memberships on Odysee.

To manage your **AR tokens**, use the [AR wallet on Odysee](https://odysee.com/$/wallet) or [Wander wallet](https://www.wander.app/) (available as a browser extension and mobile app). Wander may be a preferred choice here as it allows you to interact with the Arweave network securely and easily.

If you haven't created a wallet or installed Wander yet, we encourage you to visit the documentation page for a step-by-step guide on how to create a wallet or install Wander.
