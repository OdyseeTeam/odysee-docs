# Overview

View rewards on Odysee give creators LBC earnings per each verified view. A verified view is a view from a verified user. This means that we've verified they're a real person, in order to prevent rewards abuse. As well for preventing abuse, only the first 7 views from a verified user each day will be monetized for creators.

## How Much Do I Earn Per View?
