# Wallet Location

While on Odysee, you may have noticed the dollar icon and a number value on the top bar. This shows your total AR balance and clicking there will take you to the wallet page.

Once you have joined the wallet page you can see the new AR wallet section. To use AR on Odysee, you need to create and/or sign into Wander - a cryptocurrency wallet compatible with AR. Now you're ready to create your wallet.
