# Creating Your First Channel

In order to do things such as like, dislike, comment, and create playlists, you'll need to create a channel.

Click the avatar icon at the top right corner (if you already have a channel, this icon will be your channel's profile picture), and click on **Channels**.

From here, you'll click **Create Channel.**

If you are trying to sync your YouTube channel, you can also click the **Sync YouTube Channel** option without having to create a new channel. Note that the sync feature creates a new channel on Odysee and does not sync with an already existing channel. This means, if you already have a channel on Odysee, the videos synced from YouTube will not be added to that channel, but instead to a new one created by the sync feature.
