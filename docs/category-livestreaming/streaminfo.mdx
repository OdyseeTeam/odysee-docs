# Reusing the Stream Server/Key

It would be a hassle if after every livestream you had to change the stream server and stream key on your streaming software. Fortunately, you don't have to.

If you've streamed in the past and are planning on streaming again, simply choose the **Create or Schedule a New Stream** option, and your stream server and stream key will carry over to your next stream.
