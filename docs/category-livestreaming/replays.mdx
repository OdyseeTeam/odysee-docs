# Uploading Replays

At this time, there's no option to automatically publish livestream replays.

To publish a past livestream, you'll return to the **Publish** screen under the *Go Live* tab.

![](/img/en/category-livestreaming11.png)

From here, you'll select **Choose Replay**. If no replays appear, you can refresh by selecting **Check for Replays**.

From the menu, you'll select the livestream replay you want to publish, enter in the requested information, and select **Create** at the bottom of the page.
