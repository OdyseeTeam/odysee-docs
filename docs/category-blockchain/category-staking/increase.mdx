# Ways to Increase LBC Stake

LBC Stake is partly driven by creators themselves, and partly driven by the community.

## Deposits

The first way to increase the stake on a claim is through the credit deposit.

When initially uploading a file, you'll find **Deposit** under the **Additional Options** tab.

This will show you your current LBC stake (which defaults to 0.01 LBC), will tell you the LBC required to have the highest stake for the URL, and you'll be able to adjust your stake.

You can also adjust the deposit amount after a file has been uploaded. Simply click **Edit**, and from the edit menu you'll be able to adjust the LBC deposit.

On channels, you'll be able to change the stake under the **Credit Details** tab while editing.

## Reposts

You can improve the LBC stake of a claim by reposting it. Not only can you boost the claim's stake under its original URL, you can also increase its stake under completely different URLs.

You can repost a video or file by clicking the repost button underneath it:

From here, you can choose a deposit amount and a repost URL. The URL will default to the URL selected by the original uploader.

You could also change this URL to *anything* else and give that content the highest claim under a different URL than the original by reposting it under a new URL. The file would still keep its old URL, but would also be searchable under the new one as well.

## Boosts

If you'd like to boost someone else's LBC stake, your first option is boosting.

Under an upload, click the **Support** button.

This option is also available on channels.

![](/img/en/category-monetization6.png)

From this menu, you'll select **Boost**, select an amount, and click **Boost This Content**.

Boosts are entirely refundable. Until they are refunded, they will boost that content or channel's stake.

To refund a boost, first go to the wallet by clicking **Your Wallet**.

![](/img/en/category-wallet1.png)

From this screen, you'll select **Transactions**, and change the **Type** to Support.

When you see the boost you want to refund, simply click the trash can next to "Support," and you'll be refunded.

## LBC Tips

When an LBC tip is sent while viewing a piece of content, it boosts the LBC stake of that content until it is unlocked. Unlike boosts, **tips are non-refundable for the sender.**

To send a tip, you'll click the **Support** button under an upload.

![](/img/en/category-monetization5.png)

This option is also available on channels.

![](/img/en/category-monetization6.png)

From this menu, you'll select the **Tip** button with the LBC icon, select an amount, and click **Send Tip**.

![](/img/en/category-monetization8.png)

This LBC tip will boost the content/channel being tipped, until the creator chooses to unlock it for use elsewhere on Odysee.

To unlock a tip, first go to the wallet by clicking **Your Wallet**.

![](/img/en/category-wallet1.png)

From this screen, you'll select **Transactions**, and change the **Type** to Received.

When you see the boost you want to refund, simply click the unlock icon next to "Tip," and you'll unlock the tip.

**Do note: once a tip is unlocked, it will no longer boost the content it was originally tipped on.**

## Views

The last way to increase the stake of content is simply to get more views on that content. As more people watch a video, read an article, etc. its LBC stake will rise.
