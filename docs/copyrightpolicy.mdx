# Odysee's Copyright Policy

Uploading copyrighted content without fair use is against Odysee's [Community Guidelines](https://help.odysee.tv/communityguidelines). So, how exactly does Odysee handle DMCA requests?

## What is a DMCA request or takedown notice?
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States Copyright Law written to protect digital content against illegal use. When an owner finds their content used on the Internet without their permission, they can file a DMCA request with the website, app, or Internet Service Provider illegally hosting their content, asking for it to be removed.

## Someone uploaded my content to Odysee without permission. How do I report it?
Reporting infringing/illegal content on Odysee is easy. Navigate to the content you wish to report. In the 3 button menu, click "Report."

From here, you'll click "Infringes my rights" and then "Copyright issue."

## How does Odysee handle and respond to a DMCA request or takedown notice?
Upon receipt of a DMCA request from the content owner or legal representative, Odysee will try its best to validate the legitimacy of the request and notify the alleged infringing party about it if there's a potential for dispute. Once validated, we will block access to content in any Odysee owned applications upon receipt of a DMCA takedown notice. The opposite party can file a DMCA counter notice if they believe they have a right to publish the content. If you have questions about the DMCA process, you can find more information [here](https://www.dmca.com/faq/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown?_ga=2.159224446.539423696.1634061780-1382771933.1616852399).

## Can I dispute a DMCA complaint?
Yes, you may. We can't give you legal advice, so check with your local attorney or legal group about how to do this. There are also good resources online to learn about DMCA counter-notices. The EFF has published an [excellent guide](https://www.eff.org/issues/intellectual-property/guide-to-youtube-removals?_ga=2.164141691.539423696.1634061780-1382771933.1616852399) about how to deal with legal issues facing online content creators. If you have done the research or feel the content was blocked mistakenly, please reach out to us.
