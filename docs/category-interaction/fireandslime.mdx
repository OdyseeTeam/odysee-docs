# Fire and Slime

Odysee doesn't quite have likes and dislikes. Instead, we have fire and slime.

These days, calling something "Fire" is a compliment. In many 2000s kids game/contest shows, getting "Slimed" was used a punishment.

So, give a video a fire if you liked it. If you disliked it, give it a slime.
