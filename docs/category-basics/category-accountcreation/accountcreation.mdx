# Creating an Account

To create an account, you'll want to go to the sign up screen by clicking the <PrimaryOdyseeButton url="https://odysee.com/$/signup">Sign Up</PrimaryOdyseeButton> button. On the web version, this is at the top right corner.

On mobile, you'll click the person icon <OdyseeButtonRound ><OdyseeIcon type="person"/></OdyseeButtonRound>, which will show <OdyseeIcon type="key"/> **Sign Up** in the dropdown menu.

On the sign up screen, you'll enter an email and a password. We don't have password strength requirements, but we strongly recommend longer, complex passwords. We'll also check if your password has ever been leaked in the past, in which case you'll have to enter a new one.

**If you're attempting to sync a YouTube channel, be sure to check "Sync my YouTube channel."**

For a walkthrough of the remainder of the sync process, as well as other information about the YouTube sync program, visit our YouTube sync guide by clicking [here](https://help.odysee.tv/category-syncprogram/).

After clicking the **Sign Up** button on the previous screen, you'll be asked to confirm your email. This involves clicking a link and doing a CAPTCHA.

After confirming, your original tab will progress to this screen, where you're recommended channels to follow.
