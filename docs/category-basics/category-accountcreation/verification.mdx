# Verification

Verification is not required to use Odysee, but it is highly recommended. Verification allows you to receive some Credits simply by using Odysee. We require verification to receive some Credits, to avoid abuse.

:::info Info

Most accounts are verified automatically. Depending on factors like location, VPN use, etc. you may be asked for additional information for verification. To do this, you have a few options:

## Verify via credit card

You can also verify using a credit or debit card connected to a dollar bank account. Odysee does not store your card information nor will we charge you any fees. You may see a payment authorization of $1 in your bank account, but this will be returned to your account.

## Verify via email

You can request verification of your Odysee account by sending an email to hello@odysee.com.

:::info Note

At this time, verification requests are reviewed manually, which means they can take anywhere from a few hours to multiple days to be approved.
