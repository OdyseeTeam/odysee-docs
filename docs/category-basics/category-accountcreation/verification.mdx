# Verification

Verification isn't required to use Odysee, but it's highly recommended. Verifying allows you to earn LBRY Credits (LBC for short) simply by using Odysee. We require verification to earn LBC this way to prevent abuse.

:::info Info

To learn more about LBC and its role on Odysee, check out our [guide](/category-blockchain/).

:::

Most accounts are verified automatically. Depending on factors like location, VPN use, etc. you may be asked for additional information for verification. To do this, you have a few options:

**Via Phone Number**

Your first option is to verify through your mobile phone number. We'll send you a text message with a code.

**Via Card** 

You can also verify using a credit or debit card. We won't save your card information or charge you any fees. You may see a $1 authorization, but this will be credited once verification is completed.

**Via Chat**

Finally, you can verify through our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sWedwsNWjX) server. A moderator will review your account and, if you're eligible, approve you for rewards.

At this time, verification requests are reviewed manually, which means they can take anywhere from a few hours to multiple days to be approved.
