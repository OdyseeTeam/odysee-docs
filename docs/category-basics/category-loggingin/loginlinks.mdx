# Login Links

If you'd rather login using an email link than a password, you can select **Use Magic Link**.

This sends a confirmation email. Simply click the button in this email and complete a CAPTCHA, and you'll be logged in.

## Why Am I Being Asked to Verify Via Link?

Sometimes when logging in, you may be sent a confirmation email without requesting it. This happens when we detect an IP change or new device. The security reason behind this is to prevent people who aren't you from logging into your account, even if they know your username and password.

If you switch locations between logins or device, you'll be asked to confirm via email, even if you've used Odysee at both of those locations previously.

This can also be triggered if you use a VPN.
