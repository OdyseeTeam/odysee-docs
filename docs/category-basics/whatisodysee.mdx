# What is Odysee? 

Odysee is a blockchain-based media platform. We host all kinds of media such as images, articles, PDFs, audio files, etc., but we're best known for hosting videos.

Odysee seeks to recapture the spirit of the early 2000s era internet. Rather than favouring corporate content such as late night talk shows, network television, and TV news, Odysee is a place for everyone, including independent creators.

Referring to Odysee as "blockchain-based" isn't just sloganeering. All content on Odysee is hosted on blockchain technology, which Odysee then pulls from. For those interested in blockchain, this is really cool. For those who don't know a thing about blockchain, that's totally fine because Odysee requires zero blockchain knowledge to use.
