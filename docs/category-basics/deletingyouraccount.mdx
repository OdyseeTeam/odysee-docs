# Deleting Your Account

Currently the account deletion is partly a manual process. You can remove all content from your account and send an account deletion request using the "Delete Account" option from the [Settings](https://odysee.com/$/settings). An email confirmation will be send once the deletion has been processed.

If the option is not available on the app you use, please delete any channels and uploaded content you may have from the account first, and then email to hello@odysee.com to have the account deleted.
