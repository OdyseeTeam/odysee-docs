## Demo

This is the index site that contains a few useful formatting tools that Docusraurus offers.

### Themed images

The image toggles between light and dark mode:

![](https://i.imgur.com/vu3pTG8.png#light)
![](https://i.imgur.com/I0eaZtW.png#dark)

```markdown
![Logo with white text](/img/Logo_Transparent_White_Text.png#dark)
![Logo with black text](/img/Logo_White_Background_Black_Text.png#light)
```

```jsx
<Image
  img={require('/img/Logo_Transparent_White_Text.png')}
  class="dark-image"
/>
<Image
  img={require('/img/Logo_White_Background_Black_Text.png')}
  class="light-image"
/>
```

### Markdown

Like on Odysee.com, you can use markdown formatting as usual.

### Tabs

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In some cases, you may want to give instructions depending on the device.

#### Example use case:

How to upload content:

<Tabs groupId="appUsed">
  <TabItem value="Odysee.com" label="Odysee.com" default>
    1. This is how you upload content on Odysee.com
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Android" label="Android">
    1. This is how you upload content on Android
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Apple" label="Apple">
    1. This is how you upload content on Apple
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```markdown
<Tabs groupId="appUsed">
  <TabItem value="Odysee.com" label="Odysee.com" default>
    This is how you upload content on Odysee.com
    1. test
    2. hello
    3. 123
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Android" label="Android">
    This is how you upload content on Android
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Apple" label="Apple">
    This is how you upload content on Apple
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Metadata:

The metadata sits on the top of each file, do not translate the slug, but you can translate everything else besides the slug. Basicially, the metadata is completely optional, but it it's good to use it.

```markdown
---
// Optional: The slug defines the path, for example docs.odysee.tv/hello-world. If not defined, just the file name is being used (without the `.mdx` ending).
slug: /hello-world
// The position in which this documentation should be in the sidebar, optional.
sidebar_position: 1
// How this site should be labelled in the sidebar.
sidebar_label: 'Index'
// The title that shows up everywhere and on search engines.
title: Index
// The description, it is shown in search engines. Keep it at around 140 characters.
description: This is the index of the Odysee Help Hub... Description for search engines.
// Optional: Add a image that is shown in preview cards on social media if people share this page.
