# YouTube Sync

:::danger The option for automatically syncing your videos from YouTube to Odysee is no longer available. To ensure your content remains accessible on Odysee, we strongly encourage you to begin [manually uploading](https://help.odysee.tv/category-uploading/) your videos directly.

This approach not only guarantees your videosâ€™ presence on the platform but also makes you eligible for our future monetization program and participation in the Decentralized Media Ecosystem.
