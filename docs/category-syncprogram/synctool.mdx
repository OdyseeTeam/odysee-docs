## Why use the Sync tool?

The **Sync Desktop Tool** is designed for creators who need more flexibility. It is the ideal solution when automatic synchronization fails or does not meet the requirements for automatic synchronization.

## Why is it important?

- **Non-blocking migration:** Allows you to transfer content from your channels that may be inactive, or that simply do not meet the requirements for automatic synchronization.
- **Limit bypassing:** Allows you to sync content that does not fall within the default limits, such as exceptionally long videos.
- **Full archive:** Ensures you can bring your entire video catalog to Odysee. Use this tool to take full ownership of your migration process.

If you have a lot of manual uploads, please ask for help first to our email. Also, if your YouTube channel is not eligible for automatic sync to Odysee, please send us an email so we can help you activate the sync tool at **[hello@odysee.com](mailto:hello@odysee.com)**.

:::tip Important

- **Browser Cookies:** For channels with many videos, you may need to use the "Use browser cookies" option (right click > preferences from the taskbar).
  - We find that **Firefox** works the best on Windows.
  - You'll want to download and sign into YouTube on Firefox, and then set this option.
  - This works well for age-gated videos too.
- **Retrying:** To retry any failures, you'll need to quit and restart the app at this time.
- **New Users:** The sync tool will make a new channel for you. To sync into an existing Odysee channel, please reach out to [hello@odysee.com](mailto:hello@odysee.com).
- **Existing Synced Channels:** If you have uploaded content manually while sync was turned off, content will **not** be de-duplicated.
