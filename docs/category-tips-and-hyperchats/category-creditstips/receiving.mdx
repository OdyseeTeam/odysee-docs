# Receiving Credits Tips

When an Credits tip is sent while viewing a piece of content, it boosts the Credits stake of that content until it is unlocked. Until it is unlocked, it can't be used elsewhere on Odysee.

To unlock a tip, first go to the wallet by clicking **Your Wallet**.

From this screen, you'll select **Transactions**, and change the **Type** to Received.

When you see the boost you want to refund, simply click the unlock icon next to "Tip," and you'll unlock the tip.

**Do note: once a tip is unlocked, it will no longer boost the content it was originally tipped on.**
